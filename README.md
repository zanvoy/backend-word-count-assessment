# Word Count (Python)

In this assignment you will use your knowledge of Python basic strings,
arithmetic, file reading, and dicts to create a command line utility to count
the words in a text file ([small.txt](./small.txt) and [alice.txt](./alice.txt)).

There is an optional command line argument to print just the top 20 most frequent words in the file.
