# Word Count (Python)

In this assignment you will use your knowledge of Python basic strings,
arithmetic, file reading, and dicts to create a command line utility to count
the words in a text file ([small.txt](./small.txt) and [alice.txt](./alice.txt)).

Implement the optional command line argument to print just the top 20 most frequent words in the file.

# Debugging
Use your VSCode IDE to debug and single-step your wordcount.py -- Create two debug launch.json configurations: One with optional top_20 argument (above) and one without.

# Workflow for this Assignment
1. *Fork* this repository into your own personal github account.
2. Then *Clone* your own repo to your local development machine.
3. **NEW For this assignment**, create a separate branch named `dev/your-github-username`, and checkout the branch. Complete the missing parts of the filess.
4. Commit your changes (with _meaningful_ commit messages e.g. not 'blah' or 'asdf' or 'updated code'), then `git push` the branch back to your own github account.
5. From your own Github repo, create a pull request (PR) from your dev branch to your own master.  Invite your instructor (and any other optional reviewers such as TAs and Coaches) to your PR, so that they can get a notification.  If you don't recall how to add reviewer(s) to a PR, please refresh on [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review/)
6. Copy/Paste the URL link to your PR as your assignment submission.
